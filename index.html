        <h1>WHAT IS MINECRAFT?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <p>Minecraft is a game created for kids or teenagers, where it recreates the elements in the real world, but instead uses blocks to represent them. There are also several creatures, that can be befriended and help the player throughout their journey, or can harm and kill the player. Minecraft also has several servers, that are minigames created by other players, that the player may join and experience it themself! Minecraft seperates into 2 categories, Survival and Creative. Survival allows the player to experience and travel through the world themselves, with no given items, which the user has to gain themselves. Whereas Creative allows the user to access any item from the game available and build anything up to their imagination.</p>

        <h1>WHAT IS THE GOAL OF MINECRAFT?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <p>Minecraft has no set goal, and can be played however the player would like. Therefore, this game is sometimes called a "Sandbox Game". The user can build their own house and a small farm, or could aquire materials to defeat bosses. Or if you like being creative, you could build creative buildings or houses to go along with your house. The world of Minecraft allows the player freedom, where they could choose their own ending, depending on how the player decides to play the game. The player could also join other players world to play alongside their friends, or join servers of premade minigames from other players. Minecraft also includes a crafting feature, which further extends the countless possibilities of endings for the player.</p>

    <h1>WHAT AGE IS MINECRAFT SUITABLE FOR?</h1>
</div>
<div class="agetext">
    <p>Minecraft was designed for kids or teenagers, therefore it has a recommended PEGI rating of 7 and an ESBR rating of 10+. Everyone is welcomed to play Minecraft anytime though! But although it was made for children, combat is still apart of the game, therefore at least some element of mild violence isn't avoidable. Players can hit and defeat passive and hostile mobs, as well as other players if playing in a Multiplayer world or a server. However the graphical violence of Minecraft is limited as there is no blood included, rather the mob or player glows red when taking damage. Unwanted bullying or griefing may also be reported, making Minecraft a low violence game.</p>

    <h1>WHAT PLATFORMS CAN MINECRAFT BE PLAYED ON?</h1>
</div>
<div class="agetext">
    <p>Minecraft is availabe on Windows, MacBook, Linux, Most XBox Series, Playstation 4 & 5, Nintendo Switch, Fire OS/TV, Android, iOS, Windows Mobile, and Samsung Gear VR. Although these devices are able to play Minecraft, do beware that certain devices aren't able to play in a multiplayer game together. For example an iOS device will not be able to play together along with a Mac player, as they require different versions of Minecraft.</p>
